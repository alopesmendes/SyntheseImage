## Introduction 
This project will allow the user to create different images with a high degree of visual realism using the ray tracing technique.
## Description

> In computer graphics, ray tracing is a rendering technique for generating an image by tracing the path of light as pixels in an image plane and simulating the effects of its encounters with virtual objects. The technique is capable of producing a high degree of visual realism, more so than typical scanline rendering methods, but at a greater computational cost. This makes ray tracing best suited for applications where taking a relatively long time to render can be tolerated, such as in still computer-generated images, and film and television visual effects (VFX), but more poorly suited to real-time applications such as video games, where speed is critical in rendering each frame.Ray tracing is capable of simulating a variety of optical effects, such as reflection and refraction, scattering, and dispersion phenomena (such as chromatic aberration).

## Installation
Linux installation of sdl library
```bash
sudo apt install libsdl2-2.0-0 libsdl2-gfx-1.0-0 libsdl2-image-2.0-0 libsdl2-mixer-2.0-0 libsdl2-net-2.0-0 libsdl2-ttf-2.0-0
```
Refer to [sdl](https://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/sdl) for more details

## Usage 
In the repertory where there the Makefile type:
```bash
make
```
#### Executable:

That will generate the executable called lray.
| Options | Description                                 |
|---------|---------------------------------------------|
| -n      |Determines the level of the program<br> 1 : Will only create the image with the light.<br>2: Generates a graphic window that allow us to move the camera.<br>3 : Will launch recursive interactive rays, calculate the shadows and allow us to create mirror and transparent objects.|  
|-i      |The path file ***.txt*** that as the description of the scene|  
|-o      |The file ***.ppm*** (has to be this format) where the image will be saved. (PS: for the level 2 you can save the image with the key s of the keyboard) |  
|-ps     |Determines how many recursive interactive rays it will launch. (PS: It is only active for the level 3 and the bigger the number the waiting time will increase)|

For example the user can type
```bash
./lray -n 3 -i scene.txt -o image.ppm -ps 16
```

#### Graphic window:

If by any chance the user decides to use the level 2 the following commands to play with the camera are:  
|Categories| Commands | Description|  
|---------|-----------------|------------|  
| position| ▲<br>▼<br>◄<br>►|Moves the camera position upwards<br> Moves the camera position downwards<br>Moves the camera position leftwards<br>Moves the camera position rightwards|  
| look at | i<br>k<br>j<br>l|Moves the camera look at point upwards<br> Moves the camera look at point downwards<br>Moves the camera look at point leftwards<br>Moves the camera look at point rightwards|  
| axis | x<br>y<br>z|Positions the camera in the x-axis<br>Positions the camera in the y-axis<br>Positions the camera in the z-axis|  
| zoom | +<br>-|Zoom in<br>Zoom out|

#### Input Files format:
As said before the input files have to ***.txt*** the different separator are *{ } |*
The colors *red green blue* should always be between 0 and 1.
The values of a variable *is* are 0 for false and 1 for true.
The text before the *{* can be in upper, lower or both cases.

| Categories | Format | Description |  
|-----------|-------------|-------------|  
| image | Image { width height \| (optional) red green blue}| the color will determine the background color|  
| camera| Camera {pos_x pos_y pos_z \| look_x look_y look_z \| axis_x axis_y axis_z \| fov \| phi \| aperture \| dist}| the fov should be in degrees and the axis only one can value 1 the others shall value 0 |  
| Light| Light {pos_x pos_y pos_z \| red green blue \| intensity}| the intensity should be very elevated otherwise cannot see the scene 3e+07 as reference|  
| sphere| Sphere {pos_x pos_y pos_z \| red green blue \| radius \|(optional) ambiance_red ambiance_green ambiance_blue diffuse_red diffuse_green diffuse_blue specular_red specular_green specular_blue exponent is_mirror is_transparent}| for the optional [phong lighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phong_reflection_model) |  
| cone| Cone {center_x center_y center_z \| radius \| height \| red green blue \|(optional) ambiance_red ambiance_green ambiance_blue diffuse_red diffuse_green diffuse_blue specular_red specular_green specular_blue exponent is_mirror is_transparent}| for the optional [phong lighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phong_reflection_model) |  
| cylinder | Cylinder {center_x center_y center_z \| radius \| height \| red green blue \|(optional) ambiance_red ambiance_green ambiance_blue diffuse_red diffuse_green diffuse_blue specular_red specular_green specular_blue exponent is_mirror is_transparent}| for the optional [phong lighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phong_reflection_model) |  
| plane | Plane {pos_x pos_y pos_z \| normal_x normal_y normal_z \| red green blue \|(optional) ambiance_red ambiance_green ambiance_blue diffuse_red diffuse_green diffuse_blue specular_red specular_green specular_blue exponent is_mirror is_transparent}| for the optional [phong lighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phong_reflection_model) |  
| cube | Cube {p1_x p1_y p1_z \| p2_x p2_y p2_z \| p3_x p3_y p3_z \| p4_x p4_y p4_z \| red green blue \|(optional) ambiance_red ambiance_green ambiance_blue diffuse_red diffuse_green diffuse_blue specular_red specular_green specular_blue exponent is_mirror is_transparent}| for the optional [phong lighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phong_reflection_model) |


## Build with

 - [ ] [sdl](https://www.libsdl.org/) - The simple directmedia layer
 
 ## Authors

 - [ ] Ailton LOPES MENDES
 - [ ] Fabien LAMBERT-DELAVAQUERIE


## Bugs
The transparency does not work that well with the cube it might produce a segmentation fault.

## Conclusion 
The user can create different scenes with this version of ray tracing.  
He shall respect the format given otherwise there might be some problems.
